The current job market in the United States has many questioning the value of a doctoral degree. Critics have argued that PhD programs [exploit student labor](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/upshot/academic-job-crisis-phd.html), don't prepare you for [jobs outside academia](https://community.chronicle.com/news/2223-odds-are-your-doctorate-will-not-prepare-you-for-a-profession-outside-academe), and [exaggerate job placement statistics](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/06/fool-s-gold-phd-employment-data). These views have been largely shaped by two factors: an [increase](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf19301/report/who-earns-a-u-s-doctorate) in PhD graduates and a [decrease](https://www.aaup.org/news/data-snapshot-contingent-faculty-us-higher-ed#.X4XIMdBKjtV) in tenure-track faculty positions.
