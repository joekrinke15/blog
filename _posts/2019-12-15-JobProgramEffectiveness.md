This project was done as an assignment in IDS 702:Modeling and Representation of Data at Duke University. It was completed with the assistance of my team members [Jingjing Shi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jingjing-shi-28381ab4/), [Felipe Buchbinder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felipe-buchbinder-a65a0199/), and [Abdullah AlOthman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdullah-alothman-565048145/).

Using logistic regression and linear regression we evaluated the effectiveness of the 1975-1979 National Supported Work Demonstration. This program provided subsidized jobs in a supportive work environment to "hard-to-employ" individuals; the ultimate goal of the program was to improve employment prospects. We used the previously mentioned models inferentially, with the goal of isolating the effect of the program on wages and probability of employment. Our report and code can be seen [here](https://github.com/joekrinke15/Evaluating-the-National-Supported-Work-Demonstration/blob/master/Training_and_Wages.pdf) and [here](https://github.com/joekrinke15/Evaluating-the-National-Supported-Work-Demonstration/blob/master/Training_and_Wages.Rmd), respectively.
