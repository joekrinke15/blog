Creating a website can be a great way to showcase work in your portfolio, whether you are a data scientist, software engineer, or web developer. However, if you don't have much experience making a website, it can be difficult to find a low-cost option that is relatively simple to implement. GitHub pages combined with the static site generator Jekyll can help make the process of making a website much simpler. This post will outline the basics of creating a website by walking you through how I made a page about my dogs, Jericho and Lily. 

To begin making your website you must first have a GitHub account. You can easily register to create an account [here.](https://github.com/pricing) Once you have an account you can fork the [Jekyll repository](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) and begin editing your site.
