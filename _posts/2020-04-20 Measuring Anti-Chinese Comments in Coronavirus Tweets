# Measuring Anti-Chinese Comments in Coronavirus Tweets

Covid-19 has spread across the globe, infecting milions of people and fundamentally changing how we work and interact with others. With the proliferation of this disease also came an unexpected byproduct; anti-Chinese racism in the United States.

Since the first cases of the virus were in Wuhan, a number of individuals have blamed China and its government for the pandemic, going as far as to attack, harrass, and curse Chinese nationals and even Chinese-Americans. These flames of prejudice, some would argue, have been stoked by the U.S. president's rhetoric; he famously called Covid-19 the "Chinese Virus."

Some of my classmates (Jingjing Shi, Abdullah AlOthman, Felipe Buchbinder) and myself were interested in identifying the amount of prejudice that exists towards Chinese people and how it has changed over the course of the pandemic. We decided to use a dataset of Covid-19-related tweets collected by the [Panacea Lab](http://www.panacealab.org/covid19/) to tackle this question.
