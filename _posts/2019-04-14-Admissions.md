I applied several basic machine learning techniques to predict an individual's [chance of getting into a university given their academic credentials.](https://github.com/joekrinke15/PredictingAdmissions/blob/master/College%20Admit%20Project%20.ipynb) The analysis was done in Python using libraries including such as Pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib.
