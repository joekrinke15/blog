    "The first step in getting this data into a database is normalizing it. Normalization makes the database more efficient and flexible by reducing the amount of redundant data. The database is already in first normal form, as there are no columns that contain multiple data elements; the next step is to determine how to get it into second normal form. Second normal form is when all of the non-key columns are dependent only on the table's primary key. This sounds a bit jargony, I know, but an example may help clarify things. \n",

In the current scenario, we have a unique track id for every track in our dataset, so we could potentially use this as our primary key. If the database was in second normal form all the other columns in the table would only be dependent on the track id. This is not the case currently, as the present columns are dependent on other values in the database. For example, the track album name is dependent on the track album id. We need to break the table up into smaller tables to fix this problem.\n",
