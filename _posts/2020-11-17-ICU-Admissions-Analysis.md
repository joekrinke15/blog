In this post I'll be discussing my final project for Biostatistics 823: Statistical Programming for Big Data, a course I took at Duke University. My classmates and I built an interactive dashboard to explore ICU admission trends at Beth Isreal Deaconess Medical center. My teammates on this project were [Alena Kalodzitsa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alenakalodzitsa/), [Felipe Buchbinder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felipe-buchbinder-a65a0199/), and [Chenxi Wu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chenxi-wu-107452175/). This project would not have been possible without them. 

# MIMIC-III Dataset
The dataset we used is called [MIMIC-III](https://mimic.physionet.org/). This database contains over 60,000 ICU patient records collected from 2001-2012 at Beth Isreal Deaconess Medical Center. The data was compiled by the MIT Lab for Computational Physiology and preprocessed to protect patient identity. 

# Project Goals 
The overarching goal of our project was to examine two separate questions: do certain diseases tend to occur together and how does disease prevalence vary across demographic groups. Our target audience was hospital administrators and physicians, as they could use this information to change how their hospital responds to the needs of their community. For example, if it is found that most severe illnesses tend to occur with a preventable underlying condition (such as obesity, smoking, or mismanaged diabetes), a program could be developed to help the local community take ownership of their own health. These efforts could be further targeted by examining which demographic groups tend to experience a given health problem.
