In this post I'll be discussing my final project for Biostatistics 823: Statistical Programming for Big Data, a course I took at Duke University. My classmates and I built an interactive dashboard to explore ICU admission trends at Beth Isreal Deaconess Medical center. My teammates on this project were [Alena Kalodzitsa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alenakalodzitsa/), [Felipe Buchbinder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felipe-buchbinder-a65a0199/), and [Chenxi Wu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chenxi-wu-107452175/). This project would not have been possible without them.
