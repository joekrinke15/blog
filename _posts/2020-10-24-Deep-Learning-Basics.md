Recent advances in data collection and computational power have enabled the development and usage of many machine learning techniques. Algorithms are being used to run self-driving cars, translate documents, and even diagnose diseases. Perhaps the most famous of these techniques is deep learning, which uses layers of neural networks to extract information from the provided input. In this post I'll describe how neural networks work and use neural networks to classify images of insects.
