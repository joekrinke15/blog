I am an Interdisciplinary Data Science Masterâ€™s degree candidate at the Social Science Research Institute of [Duke University](https://datascience.duke.edu/). My education began at [Central Michigan University](https://www.cmich.edu/Pages/default.aspx), where I initially studied biochemistry with the intention of attending medical school. However, while conducting research on lung disease, I discovered that my true passion was data analysis. After graduating from Central Michigan University with a degree in statistics, I worked building predictive models for Fresenius Medical Care. In the future, I hope to apply data science to challenges in healthcare, marketing, e-commerce, and technology.
